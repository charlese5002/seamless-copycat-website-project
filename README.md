## Reflection 
#### In this project, the goal was to replicate a chosen webpage from scratch. I was inspired to choose the website seamless because of my love for food. I did this project to demonstrate and practice my learning on HTML and CSS. Throughout the process of making this project, I learned how to create a search bar, use the hover function and overlay images. Overall, this project was a positive experience because improved, practiced, and learned more about HTML and CSS.
